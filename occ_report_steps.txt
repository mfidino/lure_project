1. get all of the visits with activeStarts and activeEnds that fall between
your date range for a given study area. For these data the sql statement I used was:

Select activeStart, activeEnd, locationAbbr, vis.locationID
FROM Visits vis 
INNER JOIN CameraLocations cl
ON cl.locationID  = vis.locationID
AND isnull(activeStart) = FALSE
INNER JOIN StudyAreas sa
ON sa.areaID = cl.areaID
AND sa.areaAbbr = "CHMF"

2. Make a two dimensional array that is full of NA values. Rows equal to the
number of unique sites for a study area. Columns equal to the number of unique days between
the first and last day of the input values on site.

3. For each visit to a site, put a 0 in the associated day if it falls within the active date range
for a visit, otherwise leave it NA.

4. Query which distinct days a given species was detected at each site. 
I did a lot of this data cleaning in R because I'm sloppy at SQL. Here is 
the way too much info SQL statement I used:

SELECT *
FROM Detections
INNER JOIN DetectionSpecies
ON Detections.detectionID = DetectionSpecies.detectionID
AND Detections.valStatID = 2
INNER JOIN Photos
ON Detections.photoName = Photos.photoName
INNER JOIN Visits vis
ON Photos.visitID = vis.visitID
INNER JOIN CameraLocations
ON vis.locationID = CameraLocations.locationID
INNER JOIN StudyAreas
ON StudyAreas.areaID = CameraLocations.areaID
AND StudyAreas.areaAbbr = "CHMF"
INNER JOIN Species
ON Species.speciesID = DetectionSpecies.speciesID
AND Species.speciesID = 1

5. Go from this funky special to the days a species was observed at each site.

5. For each site, put a 1 on a day that the species was detected.

6. Generalize to multiple species, across seasons, etc. This exact set of data can be split into 4 
different seasons (one week per season) to test the output.
